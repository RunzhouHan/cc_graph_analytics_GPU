Translate the edge list format raw graph to binary csr format graph.
You need to run both the txt_to_bin_fw_int.cpp and txt_to_bin_bw_int.cpp for the same graph.
txt_to_bin_fw_int.cpp is used to extract the forward csr (out-edge) and the other one is for backward csr (in-edge).
Ignore the first lines start with '%'.
print first 64 line as verification.
